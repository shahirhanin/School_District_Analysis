# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
Throughout this project, data from fifteen different schools were organized and then analyzed to compare grades of students in each grade. The analysis was done through pandas. 
## Analysis
From our analysis we were able to notice a part of our data, specifically within the 9th grade class of Thomas High School had students cheating.
## Results
After the analysis of the data, we wanted to see if the data would be skewed or a significant change would occur if we removed the 9th grade scores from the data as a whole. 
With the removal of the 9th graders of Thomas High School we noticed these changes 
   % Passing Math went from 75 to 74.8
   % Passing Reading went from 86 to 85.7
   % Overall Passing went from 65 to 64.9
   % Average Math Scores dropped from 79 to 78.9
## Summary 
From this analysis of the data, we saw no significant change in the district based on the removal of the data of 9th graders. The cheating did affect the school however, the change was not too heavy of an impact.
